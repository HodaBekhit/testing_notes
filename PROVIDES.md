In Yocto, variables like `PROVIDES`, `DEPENDS`, and `PREFERRED_PROVIDER` help manage package relationships, specifying what packages are required, what packages are available, and which provider should be used when there are multiple choices. Let's break down each variable and then provide an example that combines them.

### PROVIDES
- **Purpose**: Specifies what a recipe "provides." This allows one recipe to define that it supplies a certain functionality or package name, which other recipes or build systems can depend on.
- **Usage**: If a recipe provides a specific library, component, or service, you can use `PROVIDES` to declare it. This is especially useful when multiple recipes could satisfy the same requirement, allowing you to indicate which recipes offer a given package.

### DEPENDS
- **Purpose**: Specifies build-time dependencies. It lists the packages or recipes that must be built before this recipe can be processed.
- **Usage**: If your recipe relies on specific libraries, tools, or other packages to build, you use `DEPENDS` to declare these dependencies. BitBake ensures that all listed dependencies are built before the current recipe.

### PREFERRED_PROVIDER
- **Purpose**: When multiple recipes provide the same functionality or package, `PREFERRED_PROVIDER` specifies which one should be used by default.
- **Usage**: When there are multiple providers for a given package or service, you can set `PREFERRED_PROVIDER_<package>` to indicate which provider BitBake should use when resolving dependencies.

### Example: Combining PROVIDES, DEPENDS, and PREFERRED_PROVIDER
Consider a scenario where you have two recipes that provide the same library (`libmath`), but one is a simplified version and the other is a full-featured version. Here's how you would use `PROVIDES`, `DEPENDS`, and `PREFERRED_PROVIDER` to manage this situation.

```conf
# Simplified version of a math library
# File: simple-math_1.0.bb
DESCRIPTION = "A simple math library"
LICENSE = "MIT"

# This recipe provides `libmath`
PROVIDES = "libmath"

# Define build and install steps
do_compile() {
    # Dummy compile step, could be more complex
    touch libmath.a
}

do_install() {
    install -d ${D}/usr/lib
    install -m 0644 libmath.a ${D}/usr/lib/
}
```

```conf
# Full-featured version of a math library
# File: full-math_1.0.bb
DESCRIPTION = "A full-featured math library"
LICENSE = "MIT"

# This recipe provides `libmath`
PROVIDES = "libmath"

# Define build and install steps
do_compile() {
    # Compile the full-featured math library
    touch libmath.a
}

do_install() {
    install -d ${D}/usr/lib
    install -m 0644 libmath.a ${D}/usr/lib/
}
```

```conf
# File: math-using-app_1.0.bb
DESCRIPTION = "An application that depends on a math library"
LICENSE = "MIT"

# This recipe depends on a math library
DEPENDS = "libmath"

# Simple compile step, assuming libmath is already available
do_compile() {
    # Compile the application, which depends on `libmath`
    touch math-using-app
}

do_install() {
    install -d ${D}/usr/bin
    install -m 0755 math-using-app ${D}/usr/bin/
}
```

```conf
# Setting the preferred provider for `libmath`
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_libmath = "full-math"  # Prefer the full-featured math library
```

### Explanation
- **PROVIDES**: Both the `simple-math` and `full-math` recipes declare they provide `libmath`. This allows other recipes to depend on `libmath` without knowing which specific implementation they get.
- **DEPENDS**: The `math-using-app` recipe depends on `libmath`. This ensures that one of the `libmath` providers is built before `math-using-app`.
- **PREFERRED_PROVIDER**: Since there are multiple providers for `libmath`, setting `PREFERRED_PROVIDER_libmath = "full-math"` specifies that BitBake should use `full-math` as the default provider for `libmath`.

Using these variables, you can manage complex dependency relationships and control which specific implementations are used when multiple options are available. This flexibility is a core feature of Yocto, allowing for modularity and customization in embedded system builds.
